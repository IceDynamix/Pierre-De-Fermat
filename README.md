read [here on github](https://github.com/IceDynamix/Pierre-De-Fermat/blob/master/Pierre_de_Fermat.pdf) (removed overleaf link because im using a local setup now but if youre thinking about starting out with latex then *please* use overleaf)

this paper contains:

* biography
  * parents
  * early life
  * studies
  * promotion
  * mathematics
  * character
* contributions to mathematics
  * analysis
  * optics
  * stochastics
    * dice problem
    * problem of points
  * number theory
    * two square problem
    * factorization method
    * little theorem
    * last theorem

everything is structured!

* sources are included in ./sources
* sections are in ./sections
* ./lib contains preamble, glossary, nomenclature (symbolverzeichnis in german) and some other temporary options
* ./img contains... well should be obvious
  * brechung.ggb opens in [geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) and can exported as tikz (located in brechung.tex with small edits)
  * factor_algorithm.nsd opens with [structorizer](https://structorizer.fisch.lu/)

this project uses a package called [dirtytalk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/dirtytalk), which is not available in miktex in the package installer (but readily available on overleaf)

edited using mainly overleaf and vscode with the latex-workshop extension

labels and references used with "fig:" prefix for pictures/figures, "sec:" for sections, "eq:" for equations

names (teachers and mine) are censored, first name is censored because our last names are actually more common than our first ones
